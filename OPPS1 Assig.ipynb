    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template that describes the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that an object of that class will have.

It is a specific representation of a class with its own set of data and behaviors.\n",

    "\n",
    "To create an object of this class, we use the class as a blueprint and create an instance of it. For example, we can create an object \"John\" of class \"Person\" with the name \"John,\" age \"25,\" and gender \"Male.\" John will have his own set of data and behaviors, which can be accessed using the dot notation. For instance, we can access John's age by typing \"John.age.\"\n",

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the practice of grouping related data and behavior together into a single unit, and then controlling access to that unit. In other words, it is the mechanism that allows an object to hide its internal implementation details from the outside world and only reveal what is necessary to use it. Encapsulation helps in making the code more secure and maintainable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of identifying the essential characteristics of an object, and ignoring the irrelevant details. In other words, it is the mechanism that allows us to focus on the important features of an object, without worrying about how those features are implemented. Abstraction helps in reducing complexity and increasing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is the mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting all the properties of the existing class, and adding new properties or modifying the existing ones. Inheritance helps in reducing code duplication, increasing code reusability, and making the code more scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism is the ability of objects of different classes to be used interchangeably, i.e., to take on multiple forms. In other words, it is the mechanism that allows a single function or method to be used with different types of objects. Polymorphism helps in increasing code flexibility, making the code more adaptable to changes, and reducing code complexity."
